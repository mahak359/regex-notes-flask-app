# regex-notes-flask-app
"A Flask-based web application for note-taking and regular expression matching."
Flask Regex & Notes UtilityA full-stack Flask application that combines a persistent note-taking system with a robust Regular Expression (Regex) matching engine. This project was refactored from a buggy template to demonstrate clean routing, proper data handling, and automated integration testing.🚀 FeaturesNote Management: Add and display a persistent list of notes within a single-page interface.Regex Engine: A "regex101" style clone that identifies and displays all occurrences of a pattern within a test string.Robust Error Handling: Catches and reports invalid Regex syntax (e.g., unbalanced parentheses) to prevent server crashes.Automated Testing: Includes a dedicated test suite to verify backend routes and HTML rendering.🛠️ InstallationClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/YourUsername/regex-notes-flask-app.git
cd regex-notes-flask-app
Install dependencies:Bashpip install flask requests
🏃 Usage1. Start the ServerRun the Flask application from your terminal:Bashpython app.py
The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000.2. Add a NoteEnter text into the Notes field and click Add Note. Your note will appear in the list below immediately.3. Test a RegexEnter a pattern (e.g., \d+) and a test string (e.g., Error 404 at 10:00) into the Regex Matcher section. Click Submit to see all identified matches.🧪 Automated TestingThis project includes an integration test suite to ensure the backend logic and frontend templates are synchronized.To run the tests:Ensure the Flask server is running in one terminal.Open a second terminal and run:Bashpython test_app.py
🐛 Bug Report SummaryA significant portion of this project involved debugging the original source code. Below are the key issues resolved:Bug TypeDescriptionResolutionRoutingHome route restricted to POST only, causing 405 errors.Enabled GET and POST methods for the index route.Data AccessUsed request.args for form data instead of request.form.Refactored to properly capture POST body data.ValidationInvalid regex patterns caused 500 Internal Server Errors.Implemented try-except re.error blocks for safe failure.TestingJinja2 whitespace caused exact-string test failures.Updated test assertions to use flexible string matching.
